# ytviewbot
should prob update this eventually

its crazy to look back at projects i made years ago when i first started learning to code, and think "holy shit i was the stupidest idiot back then", and then realize that for the most part, i'm no better now

YouTube View Bot: will be configured a list of video url's, and a time range to watch another video from the list after a random amount of time
Long description: when downloaded, a config file will be made which will contain the time range plus other possible future config options, and a list file containing the video urls.
Repo edit dates and notes will be provided after here, and when the bot is somewhat operational, I will provide a operation instructions file.
  10/21/2022: Made repo
  11/17/2022: Uploaded .py file (nonfunctional).
  11/18/2022: Made .py file work. Also started working on adding a converter so you don't have to manually figure out how many seconds are in the video, but I ran out of spare time, plus, each value (hours, minutes, seconds) must be entered separately, and I was still debugging it when I realized that I didn't have enough time to finish, so if this inconveniences you, I would love to again inform you that people who live in glass houses should fuck off. Btw, I should have it finished within a week or two, but I guarantee nothing.
  11/21/2022: Did some stuff, wasted more storage space, also copied viewbot_setup.zip to a new branch. Deal with it mfer. In case you can't push 3 buttons to find it, just click this random link: https://github.com/CoC-Fire/ytviewbot/tree/viewbot_setup
  12/8/2022: Made GUI, created new release, and again, in case you're stupid enough to not know how to download it, click this sketchy link: https://github.com/CoC-Fire/ytviewbot/releases/download/v0.0.2_gui/YT_ViewBot.zip, then extract to your user profile, then open the folder, click exe.win-amd64-3.7, then double click on viewbotappgui.exe. It's very important that you click on it twice, or the entire universe may abruptly die without prior warning. Have fun!
